# Anomaly Detection using Computer Vision

The purpose of anomaly detection via computer vision is to identify and flag instances in visual data that deviate significantly from what is considered normal or expected. Anomalies, also known as outliers, are data points or patterns that differ substantially from the majority of the data, either due to errors, defects, fraud, or any other unusual circumstances. Anomaly detection in computer vision involves leveraging machine learning and image processing techniques to automatically identify such anomalies in images or videos.

In this project, we go through the process of applying anomaly detection for the purposes of quality control and defect detection. We fit a [PaDIM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.08785) model against the [MVTecAD](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_CVPR_2019/papers/Bergmann_MVTec_AD_--_A_Comprehensive_Real-World_Dataset_for_Unsupervised_Anomaly_CVPR_2019_paper.pdf) dataset using [Anomalib](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/anomalib/tree/main), a comprehensive deep learning library designed to serve as a hub for state-of-the-art anomaly detection algorithms.
